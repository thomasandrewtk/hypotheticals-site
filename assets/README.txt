# Hypotheticals App Assets

Please add the following files to this directory:

1. hypotheticals-icon.png - Your app icon (the yellow thinking emoji)
2. hypotheticals-mockup.png - Your iPhone mockup showing the app interface

## Image Requirements

### App Icon (hypotheticals-icon.png)
- The yellow "thinking" emoji icon with rounded corners
- PNG format with transparency if possible
- At least 100x100px resolution (higher is better for retina displays)

### App Mockup (hypotheticals-mockup.png)
- The iPhone mockup showing your app interface
- PNG or JPG format
- Similar to the mockup shown in the reference image
- Should include the app interface with the game's hypothetical scenarios
- If possible, use a version with a transparent background for best results with the shadow effect

## Design Notes

The landing page follows a side-by-side layout with a dark theme:
- The app icon and name appear in the top left
- The mockup image appears on the right side with a subtle yellow glow effect
- Dark background (#1C1C1E) with white text and yellow accents
- The layout is responsive and will adjust for mobile devices

## Image Optimization Tips

For the best visual results:
- Make sure your mockup has good contrast against the dark background
- Consider adding a subtle glow to the edges of your mockup
- The iPhone mockup will automatically receive a shadow effect in the CSS
- PNG format with transparency works best for the app icon
- The yellow accent color (#FFD52E) matches your app icon for consistent branding
- Optimize images for web to keep file sizes small

If you need to edit your images, you can use image editing software like:

Once these images are placed in this directory, your website will automatically display them.
