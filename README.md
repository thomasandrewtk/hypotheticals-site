## About The Game

Hypotheticals is an engaging party game that combines quick thinking, persuasive skills, and humor. Players are divided into teams to debate thought-provoking scenarios, with app-designated "Hotshots" arguing their case as either an "Optimist" or "Skeptic". One or more "Deciders" judge the most persuasive argument, leading teams to victory.
